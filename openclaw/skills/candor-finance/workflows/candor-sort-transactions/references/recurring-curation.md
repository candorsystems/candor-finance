# Recurring curation

The recurring list is a curated schedule of predictable obligations: rent,
mortgage, subscriptions, memberships, insurance, and similar bills. Candor
detects series from posted history and fills the list on its own; you decide
which are real, what they are called, and what kind they are.

## Statuses and kinds

- `candidate`: uncertain activity awaiting your call. Candidates count toward
  nothing.
- `active`: expected to keep posting. An active detected row can still be
  unconfirmed; `confirmed` and `source` say whether the reading is yours.
- `stopped`: a real series that ended. One that posts again comes back as a
  change.
- `dismissed`: never a series. Later postings from that payee raise nothing.

`kind` decides how a series counts. `bill`, `subscription`, `loan_payment`,
and `income` are commitments. `card_payment` and `transfer` are cash
movements, totaled apart in `cash_movements`, because the purchases a card
payment settles were already counted. A mortgage is a `loan_payment`. Fix a
wrong kind with `candor recurring update RECURRING_ITEM_ID --kind card_payment --reason "This is the card payment, not a bill"`;
detection keeps your kind.

## Read a series

```sh
candor recurring get RECURRING_ITEM_ID --reason "Read the series and its latest postings"
candor transactions list --recurring-item-id RECURRING_ITEM_ID --limit 100 --reason "Read the series' full history"
```

The history read covers every posting whose label, merchant, or description
names a payee in the series' `match_rule`, so one read covers each name the
bank used. Another agreement from the same payee can appear; check amounts
against `price_levels` before counting a posting as this series'.

## Dates are windows

`predicted_next_date` is the center of `predicted_window`; a posting anywhere
in the window is on time. Say "around the 3rd", never "due on the 3rd";
contractual due dates live in account terms. `overdue` is true only when a
window closed with no matching posting, judged up to the last sync.
`paid_this_cycle` says this occurrence is already paid.

## Confirm, rename, re-time

```sh
candor recurring update RECURRING_ITEM_ID --status active --reason "Confirm a series the postings support"
candor recurring update RECURRING_ITEM_ID --merchant-name "Gym" --next-expected-date 2026-11-03 --date-tolerance-days 3 --reason "Name the gym and pin its usual day"
candor recurring update RECURRING_ITEM_ID --status stopped --reason "No posting since the cancellation"
candor recurring update RECURRING_ITEM_ID --status dismissed --reason "Repeat visits, not a bill"
candor recurring revert RECURRING_ITEM_ID --reason "Drop an override the postings no longer support"
```

Any field update confirms a candidate. Fields you set replace the observed
ones; the rest keep following detection. Set `ends_at` on a payment plan so
remaining payments are counted.

## Amount ranges

A posting joins a series when its amount is one of `price_levels` or near
the series' recent amounts. Set `amount_min` and `amount_max` together to
replace that range; both must contain the expected `amount`. Setting `amount`
alone drops a saved range back to the default. Use the history to choose the
range.

## Renamed payees and moved bills

A candidate's `possible_matches` names existing series it may belong to.
Inspect both, then join the new wording to the existing series:

```sh
candor recurring update TARGET_ID --associate-from CANDIDATE_ID --reason "The bank renamed the gym's billing name"
```

Each match lists `differences` the write refuses until they agree. A
`cashflow_role` difference means correct the role first. An
`account_identity` difference means a moved bill: stop the old series and
confirm the new one; never associate across accounts.

## Declare a bill Candor has not seen

For a bill the person names, an annual renewal with one posting, or a plan
that has not started:

```sh
candor accounts list --reason "Find the account the bill posts to"
candor recurring create --label "Rent" --account-identity-id ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_ID --direction outflow --cadence monthly --amount 1500.00 --currency USD --next-expected-date 2026-11-01 --category Housing --reason "The person named their rent so it shows on the schedule"
```

If the response warns that a similar series exists, confirm that one and
dismiss the duplicate.

## What is coming up

```sh
candor recurring list --due-within 30 --reason "List bills expected in the next month"
```

Overdue series come first, then by date. Totals cover the returned rows and
count excluded rows by reason; say when candidates or irregular series were
left out.

## A pass is done when

Every candidate you inspected has a disposition backed by its postings, and
anything ambiguous is left for the person. A harmless candidate needs no
write; say what you checked. Do not claim the whole list is clean.
